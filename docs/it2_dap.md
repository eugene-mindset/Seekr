## Iteration Backlog

### User Stories to implement...

* As someone who lost or found something, I want to be able to search for items, so if can see the listings that match by query.
* As someone who has lost something, I want to set a pin on a map of where I think I lost it, so that other users can see it and determine if the item they found might belong to me.

## Tasks

- [X] Add item matching to search bar
- [X] Add test code for search bar
- [X] Add location field for item listings
- [X] Allow user to supply location information when creating a listing
- [X] Deploy on AWS
- [x] Have unit testing
- [x] Set up continous integration with Travis CI
- [X] Switch to object-oriented model
